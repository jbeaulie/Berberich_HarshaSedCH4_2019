## data/May/raw

This directory contains raw data from May sampling. This includes raw files from instrument output (in "output" folder), as well as raw data files with this instrument output that were manually organized. 

Data files are organized based on the category of analysis: 
    
* "ch4_": files related to methane production slurry assays 
    
* "sed_": files related to sediment characteristics, including sediment porewater
    
* "microbe_": files related to microbial communities
    
* "site_": files involved in site characteristics, include water column sonde measurements, and any analyses conducted on the water column hypolimnion and epilimnion samples (water chemistry, chlorophyll, etc.)

* "meta_": metadata files.

Output files from analyses (i.e. mixing model, mothur output, etc.), master files (i.e. all sediment data combined), and all non-basic calcuation output (i.e. CH4 production rates) are found in data/May/raw.
