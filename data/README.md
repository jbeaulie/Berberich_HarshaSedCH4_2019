This contains all data for this project. It is organized into sub-folders. "May" and "July" represent the two sediment core sampling periods. Sediment trap data is separate from the May and July sediment and water sampling events. 

An example of how to download a file from here (this will download the public "test" file from the main component/page):

wget -O test.xlsx https://osf.io/qr6f8/?action=download

Note that these files can only be downloaded in this way if they are public, or if you have access because you are a contributor (you will be prompted to log in).

In order to do this wget needs to be installed on your computer. See https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/.
